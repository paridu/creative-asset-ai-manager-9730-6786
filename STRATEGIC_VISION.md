# Project: OVERLORD - The Freelancer's Digital Asset Command Center

## 1. Vision Statement
To eliminate "Digital Friction" for freelance designers by providing an invisible, AI-driven organization layer that turns unorganized folders into a searchable, high-speed creative library.

## 2. The Core Problem
Freelancers lose 20-30% of their billable hours searching for specific versions of assets, missing fonts, or buried stock photos across multiple drives and cloud services.

## 3. Strategic Pillars
- **Zero-Manual Entry:** AI identifies file types, extracts dominant colors, and suggests tags without user input.
- **Visual-First Discovery:** Search by "Vibe," "Color," or "Shape" rather than just filename.
- **Contextual Connection:** Linking assets to specific projects and clients automatically based on usage patterns.
